## cl-scgi
cl-scgi is a library server implementation of the simple common gateway interface.

The library aims to be stable at a certain point with enough tests to ensure that the functionality isn't hindred by one-time bugs. 

Currently, the status of the library is pre-alpha, with many of the features planned for being more or less missing.

Finally, the library aims to escape the Common Curseâ„¢ of Common Lisp libraries missing documentation. It aims to be extremely usable with examples all around.
